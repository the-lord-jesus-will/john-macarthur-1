          <p><span>Now, I want to go back to the book of Revelation this morning‚Äîwe‚Äôre going to be working through the
              book of
              Revelation‚Äîand I want to come to chapters 2 and 3. So just in that broad sense, I‚Äôll try to give you an
              overview of
              these two chapters. In years past, I have gone through Revelation 2 and 3 in detail. I think there are
              probably
              twenty or more sermons on just these two chapters. If you want the worm‚Äôs eye view, if you want the
              detail, it‚Äôs
              available. And we have a commentary on Revelation and a book called </span><em><span>Because the Time Is
                Near</span></em><span> to give you more detail. But for our encouragement and our help today, I want us
              to look at
              these two chapters in an overall sense because I think they are so very instructive when considered that
              way.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>Now, Revelation 2 and 3 are letters to seven churches, actual churches. Back in chapter 1, verse 11,
              John is
              told to ‚ÄúWrite in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum,
              Thyatira,
              Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.‚Äù Those are all cities in Asia Minor, which is modern Turkey. And the
              Lord
              intended that when He gave to John the book of Revelation, John would make seven copies in total. He would
              write
              down the original revelation, copy it six times, and there would be those who took it back to each of
              these seven
              churches kind of along the postal route in Asia Minor.</span></p>
          <p><span>Now, the book of Revelation is divided into three parts. If you go down to verse 19, John is told to
              ‚ÄúWrite the
              things which you have seen.‚Äù That would be the vision he just saw that I read to you earlier, the vision
              of Christ;
              that‚Äôs ‚Äú[what] you have seen. And then he is told to write ‚Äúthe things which are,‚Äù and that would be
              chapters 2 and
              3, because chapters 2 and 3 describe the present age‚Äîthe present age, the present form of the kingdom, or
              as we call
              it, the church age‚Äîand that is chapters 2 and 3. And then verse 19 says, ‚Äú[And write what] will take place
              after
              these things.‚Äù That‚Äôs the future, and that starts in chapter 4 and goes all the way to the end of
              Revelation.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>But we‚Äôre looking at chapters 2 and 3, the things which are. This is our Lord‚Äôs description in these
              seven
              letters of the church during this church age, all the way till the church‚Äôs consummation and gathering
              into the
              presence of the Lord. So to understand the age in which we live and to understand the church of which we
              are a part,
              these chapters provide tremendously helpful insight. They do so in great detail, of course, but they also
              do so with
              an overview we‚Äôll try to bring to you this morning.</span></p>
          <p><span>But before we get to chapters 2 and 3, I want to remind you of another chapter in the Bible; it‚Äôs
              Matthew 13.
              You don‚Äôt have to turn to it, I‚Äôll just make some comments on it. In Matthew 13, the Lord described to His
              disciples
              the nature of this period of time, the nature of the kingdom or the church age between His first and
              second coming.
              What the Lord said was pretty simple, really.</span></p>
          <p><span>As a general statement I would sum it up with this sentence: The church is going to be a mixture of
              true and
              false, good and bad. That‚Äôs the church. So it‚Äôs no surprise to the Lord that that is the reality that we
              understand.
              And we‚Äôre talking about the church in the broadest terms.</span></p>
          <p><span>When you go to Matthew 13, you find that He describes the church in a parable about soils. The
              kingdom, or the
              church age, is going to be defined by soils. There‚Äôs good soil, and there‚Äôs bad soil. Good soil produces
              fruit, bad
              soil produces nothing. So the church will have the unproductive false believers alongside the productive
              genuine
              believers.</span></p>
          <p><span>He then went from soil to seed, and He described another illustration that says, essentially, the
              same thing.
              There will be two seeds. There will be wheat, which will be the genuine believers planted by the Lord; and
              there
              will be tares, which are the false believers planted by Satan. So it‚Äôs a mixture of good and bad soil.
              It‚Äôs a
              mixture of‚Äîthat means good and bad hearts, and good and bad seed as well: true, planted by God; and false,
              planted
              by Satan.</span></p>
          <p><span>And then He also had another parable that expresses this very same reality. He talked about flour,
              which is
              used to bake bread, and flour that is influenced by leaven, and He was saying by that that the truth will
              have
              embedded in it the influence of error, that there will be within the framework and the experience of the
              visible
              church good and bad hearts, true and false believers, and genuine truth and evil influence. And then
              there‚Äôs another
              parable of a dragnet thrown out into the sea and pulled in, and in that dragnet were found good and bad
              fish
              mingled.</span></p>
          <p><span>So in those parables, our Lord basically laid it out for us. We should not be shocked to understand
              that the
              church is a mixture of true and false, good and bad. That‚Äôs what our Lord said.</span></p>
          <p><span>Now, it‚Äôs difficult for us to be precise in evaluating everyone. We know some people who are fake
              believers
              because it becomes obvious. But it‚Äôs beyond our ability to detect all of them. So in Matthew 13, the Lord
              basically
              said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to do the separation yourself, but wait until the harvest.‚Äù Matthew 13, verse 30, ‚ÄúAllow
              both to
              grow together until the harvest.‚Äù In other words, you don‚Äôt have the discernment, you don‚Äôt have the
              knowledge to
              begin to act as if you know the true condition of every heart; the harvest will reveal that. ‚ÄúIn the time
              of the
              harvest, I will say to the reapers, ‚ÄòFirst gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up;
              but gather
              the wheat into my barn.‚Äô‚Äù The wheat and the tares will be distinguished at the end at the harvest. And the
              harvest
              is over and again repeated in that chapter as ‚Äúthe end of the age,‚Äù ‚Äúthe end of the age,‚Äù ‚Äúthe end of the
              age.‚Äù Our
              Lord said it three times. ‚ÄúWait till the end of the age. God, using His holy angels, will bring about the
              accurate
              distinction between the fake and the real. And those that are the false will be burned up, and those that
              are the
              true will be barned up in the kingdom.‚Äù</span></p>
          <p><span>Now this prophetic description of the church age is verified most dramatically by the letters that
              our Lord
              wrote to the seven churches of Asia Minor. They point us in the direction of just exactly this, these
              seven churches
              from the first century, churches essentially founded by the apostle Paul in Ephesus to start with. And out
              of
              Ephesus came the other six churches, pastored by Paul for three years, and even by the apostle John. They
              had such
              great opportunity at Ephesus‚Äîpastored by Timothy; ministered to by Tychicus; by Apollos, the great
              preacher; by
              Aquila and Pricilla. And out of that Ephesian church came the other churches, kind of on the postal route
              going
              through Asia Minor.</span></p>
          <p><span>The interesting thing is that of the seven churches, two of them are only commended. Two of them are
              clearly
              genuine churches with true believers‚Äîtrue-hearted, genuinely converted, truly transformed believers. The
              other five
              are a mixture, and it‚Äôs a descending mixture, you might say, as we‚Äôll see in a moment. So five of these
              seven
              churches are basically given a warning by the Lord. And to reduce it down to one command, He says to them,
              ‚ÄúRepent.
              Repent.‚Äù</span></p>
          <p><span>To call a church to repentance is an unusual thing if you consider it in a kind of contemporary
              setting,
              because I‚Äôve never heard of anyone calling a church to repentance, or of any church actually repenting.
              But there
              are lots of churches that need to repent. Now these were seven genuine churches, historical churches in
              the first
              century; but they are also, at the same time, illustrations of how churches are in the rest of the church
              age. You
              will see all of the churches in the visible kingdom illustrated here in different forms of mixture.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>So to begin with, we start where Revelation 2 starts. We start with a church at Ephesus. The church
              at Ephesus,
              important to understand this: They are all believers. They‚Äôre all believers. That comes across in the
              letter in the
              first seven verses.</span></p>
          <p><span>But that introduces us to something we have to watch, because in the second church, Pergamos, there
              are some
              unbelievers, some unbelievers. In the third church, Thyatira, there are more unbelievers than believers,
              because
              believers are called ‚Äúthe rest‚Äù or ‚Äúthe remnant.‚Äù Starts out with all believers, and then some believers,
              and then
              the majority are unbelievers and believers are the remnant. And then when you get to the church at Sardis,
              there are
              only a few believers. And when you get to Laodicea, there are no believers, and Christ is on the outside
              of that
              church knocking on the door. So this is a progression from a church that is all believers; to one that is
              some
              unbelievers; to one that is a few, a remnant of believers; and then even less believers; and then no
              believers.
              That‚Äôs the progression.</span></p>
          <p><span>How does all this get started? Well, it got started in Ephesus. And that‚Äôs what I want you to
              consider as we
              think about this incredibly important portion of Scripture.</span></p>
          <p><span>The church at Ephesus had an amazing, amazing beginning, just an amazing beginning. As I mentioned,
              all those
              names that I gave you would be the bright lights of the first century church; and they all influenced the
              church at
              Ephesus, and the church at Ephesus planted those other six churches. But again, five of them, we find out,
              are in
              serious trouble. Five of them are told to repent.</span></p>
          <p><span>If you look at chapter 2, verse 5, you see that Ephesus is told to repent. If you look at chapter 2,
              verse 16,
              Pergamum is told to repent. If you look at verse 21, Thyatira is told to repent. If you look at chapter 3,
              verse 3,
              Sardis is told to repent. And Laodicea, in 3:19, is told to repent. Five of the seven churches are in
              danger, and
              the danger is ominous.</span></p>
          <p><span>Now again, there are true believers in these churches, and maybe, maybe a very, very small number of
              them at
              Laodicea. But we can identify them by one word, and that‚Äôs the word ‚Äúovercomers.‚Äù That‚Äôs used in each of
              these
              letters. Chapter 2, verse 7, ‚ÄúTo [the one] who overcomes.‚Äù Chapter 2, verse 11, ‚Äú[The one] who overcomes.‚Äù
              Again,
              that was the church of Smyrna, the good church. And then to Pergamum, verse 17, ‚Äú[The one] who overcomes.‚Äù
              And the
              same with Thyatira, the same with Sardis, and the same with Laodicea.</span></p>
          <p><span>So in these churches, there are overcomers. And what do we mean by that? What is that telling us?
              Well, John
              answered that question back in </span><a href='https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/1 John 5.5'><span>1 John
                5:5</span></a><span>. This is what John wrote in his epistle, John who also is the one who received the
              revelation: ‚ÄúWho is the one who overcomes the world‚Äù‚Äîwho is that?‚Äî‚Äúbut he who believes that Jesus is the
              Son of
              God?‚Äù John loves to use that word because it speaks not only of the sense that they believe, but of the
              power of
              that faith to give them victory over all that is satanic and all that is evil.</span></p>
          <p><span>So believers in these churches are called overcomers. And even though there are judgments pronounced
              on these
              churches, the Lord does mention that the overcomers will be rewarded. In chapter 2, verse 7, they will be
              given ‚Äúthe
              Paradise of God.‚Äù That‚Äôs heaven. In chapter 2, verse 11, they ‚Äúwill not be hurt by the second death.‚Äù
              That‚Äôs
              spiritual death and eternal death. In other words, they will live forever. In chapter 2, verse 17, they
              will receive
              ‚Äúthe hidden manna‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs divine sustenance, divine provision‚Äîand ‚Äúa white stone.‚Äù A white stone would be
              given to
              someone who was given a great honor, and the white stone might have a name written on it identifying them
              as a
              person of honor. That‚Äôs signifying the reward and the honor that the Lord will give to His own in
              glory.</span></p>
          <p><span>In chapter 2 and verse 26, the overcomer will be in the kingdom and rule with Christ; and he will
              receive
              Christ, in verse 28‚Äî‚Äúthe morning star‚Äù is Christ. He will receive Christ. Christ will belong to him, and
              he to
              Christ. In chapter 3 and verse 5, the overcomer will ‚Äúbe clothed in white garments.‚Äù That‚Äôs righteousness,
              purity.
              His name would never be erased from the book of life. People had their names erased out of city rolls if
              they
              committed certain crimes or atrocities. No one‚Äôs name will ever be erased out of God‚Äôs book; but rather,
              that name
              of the believer, the overcomer, will be confessed by Christ before His Father and before the holy
              angels.</span></p>
          <p><span>And in chapter 3, verse 12, the overcomer will be made ‚Äúa pillar in the temple of My God, and he will
              not go
              out from it anymore; and I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the
              new
              Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new name.‚Äù The Lord is going to do divine
              graffiti all
              over those who are His, identifying them as such. And then, finally, in verse 21 of chapter 3, the
              overcomer will
              sit on the throne with the Lord, as He overcame and sat down with His Father on His throne. So what we
              have, then,
              is a mixture in the church. Sometimes mostly all, if not nearly all believers, like in Ephesus; or
              sometimes very,
              very, very few, even hard to recognize, like in the church of Laodicea; and in between, all the other
              levels of
              mixture.</span></p>
          <p><span>Now collectively, these churches had been corrupted by the assaults of Satan internally, internally.
              Persecution had come to some of these church as well, but it seems as though the persecution had a
              positive effect.
              For example, the church of Smyrna, in chapter 2, verse 8, they are identified as ones who are about to
              suffer, verse
              10, be thrown ‚Äúinto prison,‚Äù to ‚Äúbe tested,‚Äù and ‚Äúhave tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death,
              and I‚Äôll
              give you the crown of life.‚Äù There‚Äôs no condemnation of anything or anyone in that church. Persecution had
              a
              purifying effect.</span></p>
          <p><span>And the other church that has no condemnation is the church at Philadelphia in chapter 3, and they
              also
              experienced persecution, verse 10, ‚ÄúYou have kept the word of My perseverance, [and I‚Äôll] keep you from
              the hour of
              testing.‚Äù They had been tested, and they had proven faithful. And the Lord would keep them from any
              further testing,
              even though they were in the very synagogue of Satan, you might say, as it says in verse 9.</span></p>
          <p><span>So persecution from the outside has a purifying effect on two of these churches. The other five,
              Satan corrupts
              it from the inside, from the inside. And the corruption includes sexual immorality, idolatry, compromise
              with the
              world, tolerance of sin, false teaching, hypocrisy, error, preaching for money. It could be summed as
              sinking into
              the depths of Satan. That‚Äôs language that is used here: sinking into the depths of Satan.</span></p>
          <p><span>So it‚Äôs instructive for us to see this in a big-picture sense. But let‚Äôs start with the church at
              Ephesus and
              watch how the progression goes, OK. And each of these letters begins with, ‚ÄúTo the angel‚Äù‚Äîor ‚Äúthe
              messenger.‚Äù And
              the messenger would be a representative of each church. It‚Äôs </span><em><span>angelos</span></em><span>,
              but it can
              be translated ‚Äúmessenger.‚Äù This was probably an elder or leader from each of the seven churches who came
              and
              received the letter from John, and it was taken back. ‚ÄúTo the angel of the church [at] Ephesus write‚Äù‚Äîand
              then the
              Lord identifies Himself by the imagery found in the vision in chapter 1, so we know who is
              speaking.</span></p>
          <p><span>What do we know about this church at Ephesus? Well, look at verse 2: ‚ÄúI know your deeds, your toil,
              your
              perseverance . . . you cannot tolerate evil men, you put to the test those who call themselves apostles,
              and they
              are not, and you found them to be false; and you have perseverance and have endured for My name‚Äôs sake,
              and have not
              grown weary.‚Äù That‚Äôs all commendation.</span></p>
          <p><span>Now you have to remember that Ephesus was a frighteningly pagan place. It was the center of the
              worship of
              Diana of the Ephesians, or Artemis. Scores of eunuchs and thousands of priestesses and prostitutes,
              unnumbered
              herald singers, people playing musical instruments and dancers. It was kind of an orgiastic worship there,
              a
              hysteria where people work themselves into frenzies and shameless sexual mutilations. And huddled in this
              pagan
              environment was a church, a group of men and women proclaiming the name of Jesus Christ; and in spite of
              all of the
              things around them, they were being faithful.</span></p>
          <p><span>Just look at verse 2 again: ‚ÄúI know your deeds‚Äù‚Äîyour service, your labor‚Äî‚Äúyour toil, your
              perseverance‚Äù‚Äîyour
              endurance‚Äî‚Äúyou don‚Äôt tolerate evil. You put to test those who falsely call themselves apostles.‚Äù Verse 3,
              ‚ÄúYou have
              perseverance, and you have endured for My name‚Äôs sake.‚Äù In other words, ‚ÄúYou do what you do for My glory,
              and you
              have not grown weary.‚Äù They‚Äôre strong doctrinally. They‚Äôre strong in terms of their zeal for ministry.
              They‚Äôre a
              busy group of people pursuing things that are ordained in Scripture.</span></p>
          <p><span>Everything sounds great until you get to verse 4, and then this hits with a jolt: ‚ÄúBut I have this
              against you,
              you have left your first love.‚Äù Nothing has shown up on the outside yet. But the Lord looks at the inside,
              and He
              says, ‚ÄúThere is a very serious flaw. You have left your first love.‚Äù What is that? Well, your first love
              was that
              initial love for Christ that you felt when you were taken out of the kingdom of darkness and brought into
              His
              kingdom‚Äîthat initial exhilaration and joy and passion for knowing Christ, and understanding His word, and
              communicating with Him in prayer, and worshiping Him with the saints, those early impulses that drove you
              in the
              direction of Christ. You didn‚Äôt know enough theology to be smugly confident and satisfied with your
              doctrine. It was
              all Christ and only Christ, and you were lost in wonder, love, and praise.</span></p>
          <p><span>None of us should ever leave that point. That could be described as the spiritual honeymoon. It came
              into your
              life when the Lord rescued you, when the Lord saved you. But over time,
            </span><em><span>good</span></em><span>
              things replaced </span><em><span>the best</span></em><span> thing, and love for Christ is replaced by love
              for
              ministry, love for theology, love for other people; and the fire that once burned in your heart has cooled
              significantly.</span></p>
          <p><span>In verse 5, the Lord says to those in this situation, ‚ÄúYou have fallen.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have fallen.‚Äù You‚Äôre
              going down;
              you‚Äôre going the wrong direction. And He says, ‚ÄúRepent.‚Äù But He says, first of all, ‚ÄúRemember where you
              have fallen
              from.‚Äù Remember those first impulses of love for Christ. Remember. And then He says, ‚ÄúRepent.‚Äù And then He
              says
              repeat: Go back and ‚Äúdo the deeds you did at first.‚Äù And this is so important, so critical, that ‚ÄúIf you
              don‚Äôt do
              this, I‚Äôm going to come to you and remove your lampstand out of its place. I‚Äôm going to literally shut the
              church
              down. I‚Äôm going to come against you, not because your theology is wrong, not because you‚Äôre not busy
              serving, but
              because you have replaced your love for Me with something else.‚Äù</span></p>
          <p><span>Look, this is not an attack on their theology. He says in verse 6, ‚ÄúYou hate the deeds of the
              Nicolaitans,
              which I also hate.‚Äù As an illustration, ‚ÄúI understand your doctrinal fidelity.‚Äù Nicolas was some man who
              came up
              with a notion that you were under grace and you could live any way you wanted to live, kind of
              antinomianism, and he
              led people to think they could sin with impunity because they were under grace. And the Lord hated that,
              and so did
              the Ephesians.</span></p>
          <p><span>But in spite of all their theology and all their orthodoxy, they needed to repent of the coldness of
              their
              hearts toward Christ. They needed to go back and remember what that love was like when they first knew
              Him, and
              repeat things like prayer, study of the Lord in His Word, fellowship, gathering for worship. That should
              be the
              priority. ‚ÄúChrist must be everything, or I‚Äôm going to come against you.‚Äù And by the way, He did; and the
              light went
              out.</span></p>
          <p><span>The second church is the church at Pergamos, and He says to them, verse 12, ‚ÄúThe One who has the
              sharp
              two-edged sword.‚Äù That‚Äôs a giveaway because a sharp, two-edged sword is wielded against error. So now when
              we get to
              Pergamos, we have a church ‚Äúwhere Satan‚Äôs throne is.‚Äù This is a city which was basically a capital for
              idolatry, a
              world center, you might say, for idolatry. It could refer to emperor worship, since Pergamos was
              considered the
              capital for the worship of Caesar. It could be because there was a massive throne built there as an idol
              of Zeus, a
              most famous altar in the world. Or it could be because of the worship of the god Asclepius, who was
              believed to be a
              healing god, and he‚Äôs identified with a snake and called the Pergamese god. The way you were healed was
              there was a
              floor in the temple to Asclepius. It was crawling with snakes; and to be healed, you went in and put
              yourself
              prostrate on that floor and let the snakes crawl over you, and if touched by a snake, it was the healing
              touch of
              Asclepius. If it was anything, it was demonic, from Satan himself, who is disguised as a serpent.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>But in the midst of this, now we know we have more unbelievers. In the midst of this, He says, verse
              13, ‚ÄúYou
              hold fast My name, and didn‚Äôt deny My faith even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who
              was killed
              among you, where Satan dwells.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still faithful, some of you.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut‚Äù‚Äîagainst the larger group, we
              could
              assume, I think‚Äî‚ÄúI have a few things against you,‚Äù verse 14. ‚ÄúThere are some who hold the teaching of
              Balaam, who
              kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols
              and commit
              acts of immorality.‚Äù Balaam was a prophet who was trying to, under the leadership of Balak, king of Moab,
              seduce
              women, Moabite women, to seduce Jewish men to have intermarriage and bring about idolatry. And that‚Äôs
              exactly what
              happened‚Äîidolatry and immorality.</span></p>
          <p><span>In verse 15, He says, ‚ÄúYou . . . have some who . . . hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.‚Äù So now
              there are
              some still mingling with idolatry and immorality, which was not only a part of Balaam‚Äôs
              identification‚Äîback in
              Numbers 22‚Äîbut also a part of the paganism from which these churches had emerged. ‚ÄúYou have some that have
              bought
              into the church false-teaching freedoms of the Nicolaitans.‚Äù ‚ÄúTherefore repent; or else I‚Äôm coming to you
              quickly,
              I‚Äôll make war [with] them with the sword of My mouth.‚Äù So this is really a mixed church.</span></p>
          <p><span>Ephesus had no unbelievers identified. Smyrna had no unbelievers identified. But once first love
              cools, things
              can begin to change. And the church at Pergamos was experiencing the world coming to them. They were
              feeling the
              power of their pagan idolatry and the acts of immorality that went with that. Compromisers. Compromisers.
              That‚Äôs
              what He‚Äôs talking about. You have there, verse 14, ‚Äúsome who hold the teaching of Balaam.‚Äù ‚ÄúSome.‚Äù So we
              could
              assume that the believers were still in the majority, but there were compromising people there, and that
              was going
              to take a horrendous toll. So in verse 16, ‚ÄúTherefore repent; or else I‚Äôm coming to you, and [making war
              with] you
              [from] the sword of My mouth,‚Äù which, of course, is the symbol of His authoritative word of
              judgment.</span></p>
          <p><span>Then you come to Thyatira. In the progression, looking at the five churches that were called to
              repent, this
              church is not just being seduced by the world, this church is now tolerating sin. Again, He identifies
              Himself in
              verse 18 by imagery from chapter 1, and says, ‚ÄúI know your deeds, your love, your faith, your service,
              your
              perseverance, and your deeds of late are greater than at first. There are good things about you. There are
              good
              things about you.‚Äù</span></p>
          <p><span>Back in the church at Pergamos, in verse 14, He said, ‚ÄúI [just] have a few things against you,‚Äù which
              means it
              was, perhaps, just a few at that point who were involved in these idolatrous things. Here, He says, ‚ÄúYou
              have good
              deeds‚Äîlove, faith, service, perseverance‚Äîand you‚Äôre even improving the deeds that you are engaged in.‚Äù
              ‚ÄúBut I have
              this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess, and teaches and
              leads My
              servants astray.‚Äù So now they have a woman preacher who‚Äôs a prophetess, who is identified as a Jezebel
              because she
              seduced people into immorality and adultery.</span></p>
          <p><span>So now the church at Thyatira is full-scale into idolatry and immorality in that they‚Äôre allowing it
              to be
              taught. It‚Äôs being promoted. And He says in verse 21, ‚ÄúI gave her time to repent, she doesn‚Äôt want to
              repent of her
              immorality. [So I‚Äôm going to] throw her in a bed of sickness, and those who commit adultery with her into
              great
              tribulation, unless they repent of [their] deeds.‚Äù And it is very severe: ‚ÄúI will kill her children with
              pestilence‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill them‚Äù‚Äî‚Äúand all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds
              and hearts;
              and I‚Äôll give to each one of you according to your deeds. But I say to you, the rest‚Äù‚Äîso now we know that
              the true
              believers are down to ‚Äúthe rest,‚Äù the remnant. The majority are now caught up in this tolerance of sin,
              immortality,
              and idolatry.</span></p>
          <p><span>‚ÄúBut [to] the rest . . . who do not hold this teaching,‚Äù that small remnant of believers ‚Äúwho have
              not known
              the deep things of Satan, as they call them‚ÄîI place no other burden on you.‚Äù I only ask that you ‚Äúhold [on
              to what
              you have] until I come.‚Äù And then He makes the promise of eternal blessing and His kingdom to them.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>Tolerance of sin. So He goes from leaving your first love; to compromising with the world; to,
              literally,
              opening the doors, inviting sin in, and tolerating that sin.</span></p>
          <p><span>Now we come to the fourth church in chapter 3, the church at Sardis, again, identified by imagery
              from chapter
              1. Verse 2, ‚ÄúWake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die.‚Äù So now we‚Äôve got a
              church
              that‚Äôs got very little left, and it‚Äôs on its deathbed. So you can see gradually from all believers, to
              some
              unbelievers, to a few believers, to a remnant so small they can‚Äôt even keep the church alive. There were a
              few.</span></p>
          <p><span>‚ÄúRemember.‚Äù Again, ‚ÄúWake up, strengthen things that remain,‚Äù verse 3, ‚Äúremember what you have
              received and
              heard; and keep, and repent.‚Äù It‚Äôs, again, ‚ÄúRemember. Repent.‚Äù ‚ÄúTherefore if you do not wake up, I will
              come like a
              thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come and bring judgment on your
              church.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut
              you have a few . . . in Sardis who have not soiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white,
              for they are
              worthy.‚Äù By the way, Sardis today is a pile of ruins. The church, even in the time this was written, was
              on its
              deathbed.</span></p>
          <p><span>This is the church that really is no church. Oh, there may be a straggling few believers there. But
              this is the
              church that we would say is involved in politics, social work, welfare, psychology. This is ‚ÄúThe Rime of
              the Ancient
              Mariner.‚Äù You remember Coleridge: ‚ÄúCorpses man the ship; dead men pull the oars; dead men steer the
              vessel.‚Äù This
              was Sardis, the dead church, right at the very end of its very existence, barely alive. Verse 1, ‚ÄúYou have
              a name
              that you‚Äôre alive, but you‚Äôre dead.‚Äù The only reason I say not completely is because of verse 5: There are
              overcomers who will ‚Äúbe clothed in white garments,‚Äù whose names will never be removed from the book of
              life, and
              whom ‚ÄúI will confess . . . before My Father and before [the] angels.‚Äù This church had a lot of activity, a
              lot of
              activity‚Äî‚Äúdeeds.‚Äù It acted as if it was alive; but it was dead. The Lord commands them to remember and to
              repent and
              to wake up and to strengthen.</span></p>
          <p><span>And then you come to the fifth church, Laodicea‚Äîskipping Philadelphia. And this is the final end of
              this
              decline: ‚ÄúTo the . . . church ]at] Laodicea‚Äù‚Äîagain, identifying Himself in verse 14‚Äî‚ÄúI know your deeds.‚Äù
              And He has
              nothing good to say. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre neither cold nor hot; I wish you were cold or hot.‚Äù Interesting little
              background to
              that.</span></p>
          <p><span>Hierapolis was very close to Laodicea. It had famous hot springs; and hot springs were very
              therapeutic and
              beneficial to people. And also, not far away was Colossae, which was known for its cold mountain brook
              bringing down
              fresh water. But Laodicea received its water from filthy aqueducts‚Äîtepid, kind of dirty water. And that
              becomes an
              image for the Lord in this letter: ‚ÄúI wish you were cold or hot‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúI wish you had some redeeming
              virtue‚Äù‚Äî‚Äú]but
              because you‚Äôre lukewarm, and neither hot or cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.‚Äù This is the fully
              apostate
              church. It‚Äôs not even cold, you could say. It‚Äôs not even hypocritical. It doesn‚Äôt pretend to be
              hypocritical. It‚Äôs
              like the Methodist church I heard about the other day that held a special blessing service in the front of
              the
              church up on the platform for all of those drag queens who wanted to receive God‚Äôs blessing. They‚Äôre not
              even
              pretending to follow the Word of God. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not hypocritical, nor are you passionate about the things
              you should
              be. You‚Äôre not cold, you‚Äôre not cold, you‚Äôre just disgusting. You‚Äôre without God.‚Äù</span></p>
          <p><span>Look at verse 17, ‚ÄúYou say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm rich,‚Äô you have become wealthy. You have need of nothing.‚Äù You don‚Äôt
              know that
              here‚Äôs your true spiritual condition: wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. That‚Äôs an unconverted
              description
              if ever I read one. ‚ÄúAnd I advise you to buy from Me gold . . . that you may become rich, and white
              garments that
              you may clothe yourself, and the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint
              your eyes so
              that you may see.‚Äù He‚Äôs playing off three of the most important industries in Laodicea: mining for gold,
              the wool
              industry, and some kind of eye salve. And He‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄúYou need a different kind of gold, you need a
              different
              garment, and you need a different salve‚Äîone that will produce righteousness and spiritual sight.‚Äù</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>Verse 19, ‚ÄúThose whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.‚Äù The Lord
              expresses
              even love for this church; calls on them to repent.</span></p>
          <p><span>And then verse 20 is such an important verse because it‚Äôs quoted so often. It‚Äôs not about a personal
              experience
              where Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart. This is Jesus knocking on the door of the church at
              Laodicea
              because He‚Äôs not in there. He‚Äôs not even there. This is a church without Christ. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going to let Me
              in?‚Äù He
              says. ‚ÄúIs there anybody who will let Me in?‚Äù</span></p>
          <p><span>This is what you see in the church even today. You‚Äôve got churches, believers only, and you‚Äôve got
              every
              degradated form of that‚Äîor degraded form of that, sequentially down to the church that has no believers.
              And that‚Äôs
              what our Lord said. It would be a mixture, and it would be hard to discern and separate all of this. But
              that will
              come in the harvest at the end of the age. Two faithful churches: Smyrna, persecution kept them faithful;
              Philadelphia, persecution and a passion for evangelism kept them faithful.</span></p>
          <p><span>This is how it is in the church age, and it‚Äôs such a severe warning that the Lord seven times repeats
              this line
              in every letter: ‚ÄúHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you
              listening? Do you
              understand? If you go down this path, I will judge you. I will come against you, I will fight you, I will
              put you
              out of business, and you will be nothing but a shell, nothing but a fraud, nothing but a fake. You will be
              Satan‚Äôs
              church, not My church.‚Äù</span></p>
          <p><span>So important to see these letters in this view, because we have to understand that what we‚Äôre seeing
              in the
              church age is exactly what the Lord said we would see in Matthew 13, and exactly what He did see as the
              letters in
              Revelation 2 and 3 indicate. Nothing has changed other than what God had purposed and planned. And this is
              what He
              said Satan would do. But He also said in the end, the overcomers will all triumph eternally. And in the
              end, as 2
              Corinthians 2 says, we will all triumph in Christ.</span></p>
          <p><span>The true church will always be the true church. We will be the ones who receive the blessings
              promised to the
              overcomers. You may be a part of a church that‚Äôs like Ephesus, or you may be one of two or three in a
              church like
              Laodicea. The Lord knows those that are His. It says that the Old Testament comes to an end. The Lord
              knows those
              who are His. He remembers them. He identifies them. They‚Äôre like jewels to Him, and He protects
              them.</span></p>
          <p><span>But faithfulness for the church is the command. And that faithfulness means repent, remember, and
              repeat, if
              you‚Äôre sliding. And the front end of this picture, if you‚Äôre losing your first love and there‚Äôs anything
              you love
              more than Christ, that‚Äôs a slippery slope you don‚Äôt want to be on. And we certainly don‚Äôt want that for
              our beloved
              church. Let‚Äôs pray.</span></p>
          <p><span>Father, clarity of truth coming from the pages of Holy Scripture leaves us without excuse, calls us
              to absolute
              faithfulness to You. And we desire that. It‚Äôs not a burdensome thing to love You with all our heart, soul,
              mind, and
              strength. It‚Äôs not a difficult duty to love You above all other objects and all other persons. It‚Äôs not
              hard for us,
              Lord, to give You first place in our lives, in our affections, in our minds, in our hearts, in our speech,
              and in
              our actions, because You deserve it. And You have given us what we don‚Äôt deserve: eternal salvation. How
              could we do
              less than to give You back what You do deserve as a God of such magnanimous grace. Be with us now, Lord,
              as we come
              to the Table and remember the cross at which You purchased our glorious salvation.</span></p>
